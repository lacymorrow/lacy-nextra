# Flash Interactive User Interface

In the early 2000's, I was hired to create some novel user interaction designs for a website (this was before such a thing as a "web application"). Being old and outdated, many features are now broken but the idea and uniqueness remains. Click and drag a topic to the screen and play around!

The original supported music, video, news, and photos.

## Demo

  Some of the APIs used in this demo are no longer available, so some features are broken. The demo is also not responsive, so it will not work on mobile devices.
