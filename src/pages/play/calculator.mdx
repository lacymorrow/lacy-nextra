A collection of finished and unfinished games and utilities written in BASIC for the TI-83/84/+. Completed apps:

**Drawout**: A drawing application with a few features and enhancements.

**Jackpot**: A casino-style slot machine, using characters rather than images.

**Jumper**: My personal favorite, a simple jumper. Press the button, jump over the whole.

**Matches**: Also called Nim, a classic two-player puzzle game. Play a friend or the computer. Force your opponent to take the last match.

**Mazeworm**: A complex snake-esque game. Make your way through increasingly difficult mazes without touching the walls. Accepts custom maps.

**RPS**: Rock-Paper-Scissors.

**Tic-Tac**: Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Trigger**: An assasination game modeled after the Sniper assembly games.

**Whack**: Whack-a-mole on your calculator.
